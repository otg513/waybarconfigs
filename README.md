# waybarconfigs
These are my personal configs for waybar on omarchy, an opinionated arch linux + hyprland setup. Some waybar buttons use commands/CLIs that do not come with Omarchy. Please download these packagaes before using this config. The packages are as followed: stormy (weather cli, requires some seperate setup with location, but API comes with), tstock (stock cli, you will need to setup an Alpha Vantage API key for this one). You will have to move the config.jsonc into ~/.config/waybar/ and delete the other one that is in the directory. After you've put the config into the directory, change will not apply immediately so either download the waybarreset.sh script and make it executable, or just do "pkill waybar" and then "waybar &" . The numbers of workspaces 1-5, and Omarchy button logo on the left-side of the waybar are replaced with custom icons.
